snapshot_dir=/home/snapshot

workdir_comment=Change location of work directory, you can make it different than snapshot_dir. Make sure you have enough free space on that partition. Only Linus filesystems that allow bind mountpoints are allowed. If the program detects the partions doesn't allow bind mountpoint it will choose worddir from /tmp, /home, snapshot_dir depending which one has more free space
