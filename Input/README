README file for Input/ directory for build-antiX-iso
====================================================

Besides the files under the Template/ directory, almost all of
the inputs to the program are in files under this directory.

The Files
---------

README
    This file.

Deb/
    A subdirectory (with its own subdirectories) that are created
    whenever the program runs stage-0.  These are for holding
    last-minute .deb files that have not made it into the repos.
    We do some clever filtering so usually you can just dump all
    the .deb files into Deb/COMMON/

defaults
    The main default settings.  These are almost all the settings
    that determine what will end up in the iso file.   The idea
    is that these files can be passed around and shared without
    the need for the recipients to make any modifications.

defaults-local
    These are settings that are customized to this local system.
    Settings in this file will override settings in "defaults"
    and in "defaults-system".  They include:

    ENABLE_LOCALES  Which set of locales to enable on the iso.
                    This is one of the few exceptions where a
                    setting that is not in "defaults" can affect
                    what is on the iso file.

    ISO_SYMLINK     A symlink created after an iso file is made.
                    I use this for running the most recent iso
                    file in Virtual Box.

    LOCAL_MIRROR    The Debian mirror used by the host system.

defaults-system
    These are settings on the opposite end of the spectrum.
    These seldom need to change unless there is a major new
    feature added to the program.  Because these seldom change,
    these variables won't show up in the --pretend output or at
    the end of stage-0 unless you add the --verbose option.
    These settings will get overridden by settings in "defaults"
    and in "defaults-local".

    APT_GET_OPTS    Standard option sent to apt-get

    CACHE           What should be cached.  Currently,
                    "debootstrap" is the only option

    CACHE_EXPIRE    How many days to wait before expiring cache
                    files.

lax-errors.regex
    This file consists of "sed" regular expression, one per line.
    When we are in lax error checking mode (this is usually
    synonymous with running apt-get or its brethren) then any
    line of stderr output that matches any one of these
    expressions will be flagged as an error.  There is is so much
    stderr output from apt-get that it is not practical to make a
    list of regular expressions for everything that should be
    ignored.  So we ignore all stderr output by default and only
    pay attention to messages that match one or more of the
    expressions in this file.

strict-exceptions.regex
    For most of the rest of the processing *inside* the stages,
    we are in strict error checking mode where any stderr will be
    treated as an actually error, *except* for messages that
    match one or more of the regular expressions in this file.


Notes
-----

NOTE: The adventuresome user has some flexibility over where
they put variables in the 3 defaults files.  Some of the
variables you can leave out altogether in which case you will
be prompted for the value every time the program runs stage-0.

For example the Examples/defaults.music file defines both
ISO_FLAV and ISO_RESPIN_OF so if this file is used then the user
won't be prompted to give values for these variables.

The variables we prompt for are:

    ARCH
    CODE_NAME
    DEBIAN_RELEASE
    DISTRO_NAME
    DISTRO_VERSION
    ENABLE_LOCALES
    ISO_FLAV
    ISO_RESPIN_OF
    K_REVISION
    K_TEMPLATE
    K_VERSION
    LOCAL_MIRROR
    NEW_HOSTNAME

The variables we DO NOT prompt for are:

    APT_GET_OPTS
    CACHE
    CACHE_EXPIRE

    K_TEMPLATE
    LIVE_USER
    LOCALE
    MIRROR
    RELEASE_DATE
    TIME_ZONE
    X_TERM_EMULATOR

The first 3 are the 3 variables that are in the defaults-system
file.  It would be trivial to add yet another defaults file for
the other 7 variables in this list.  Things like LOCALE, MIRROR,
and TIME_ZONE could go into defaults-local if someone wants to
over-ride the default US oriented values.

If we prompt for a variable then we automatically save the answer
in a defaults file if the variable is defined in at least one
file.  If a variable is defined in more than one file then we
change the file that has the highest priority.  In order of
priority, the files are:

    defaults-local
    defaults
    defaults-system

Note:  using the --user-default switch will allow the user to specify an alternate file to use in place of "defaults"
