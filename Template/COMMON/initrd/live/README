******* PRELIMINARY *******

=============================
antiX/MX Live Boot Parameters
=============================
The boot menus in the legacy bootloader provide a convenient GUI for
setting some of the options documented here.  Use the F12 key in the
bootloader to see what boot options are selected by your current menu
choices.  Many of the advanced features of the Live system only work on
a live-usb (or a frugal install).


BOOT OPTIONS
------------
These options control how the Live media boots.  In particular the
control where we look for the linuxfs file.  The location of this
file will be used for other Live features such as persistence and
remastering.

The Boot Device
---------------
The primary job of Live initrd is to find the compressed file system
called a Isquashfs file.  For antiX and MX this file is normally named
linuxfs.  We need to find the device this file is on and find the file
on that device.

Normally we scan all cdrom (and dvd) and usb devices for that file.
This default behavior can be modified with the following options.  The
easiest way to specify the boot device is the "from" option which
specifies what type of device to boot from:

    from=<hd|usb|cd|all>

Valid values "cd hd usb".  More than one is allowed.  The default is
"usb,cd" so by default we will only look at cdrom/dvd devices and usb
devices for the boot directory.

You can also specify a device more specifically but giving a device name
(like "sda1"), a partition label, or a partition UUID.

    bdev=*

The name of the boot device.  For example "bdev=sda1".

    blab=*

The partition label of the boot device.

    buuid=*

The UUID of the boot device.  Wildcard characters such as "*" are allowed
which can be useful if you don't want to type in the entire URL.

The Boot Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    bdir=*

By default, we look for the "linuxfs" file and and persistence files in
the "/antiX" directory on the boot device.   If you want to boot more
than one Live system on the same device or if you want to do a frugal
install, you should change that directory and use the "bdir" parameter
to point to the new directory.  The leading slash is optional.

    sq=*

Specify the linuxfs file plus the boot directory all at once.  The
default is "/antiX/linuxfs".  The leading slash is optional.


X-Windows Options
-----------------

These options affect X-windows.  They will all be carried over when you
do an install.  The various keyboards options are carried over in the
file "/etc/defaults/keyboard".  The X-Windows options are carried over
in the file "/etc/X11/xorg.conf".  The two main boot parameters far
controlling X-Windows are "xorg=*" and "nomodeset".

    xorg=*

This parameter allows you to set the video driver and screen resolution.

Keyboard Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A rather complete list of keyboard options and variants is usually available at
"/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst"

    kbd=*

Set the keyboard layout.  This is usually one or more 2-letter country
codes separated by commas.  For example: "kbd=gr,us".  This will allow
users to quick switch between the US and the Greek keyboard layouts.

    kbopt=*

Keyboard options.  These give special meaning to certain keys or key
combinations.  For example "kbopt=ctrl:nocaps" turns the Caps Lock key
into an extra Control key.

    kbvar=*

Keyboard variant.  These are variants to the keyboard layout.  For
example "kbvar=dvorak" will give you a Dvorak layout when you use the
"us" layout.

Video Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These options affect the X-windows video.

    fontsize=*

Adjust the size of the font in X-windows.  This does the same thing as
setting DPI (see below) but the scale is relative to the default font
size.  So setting fontsize=1 does nothing.  Setting fontsize=1.1 makes
the fonts 10% larger and so on.

    dpi=*

DPI stands for "dots per inch".  It controls the size of most fonts.  A
larger DPI value will give you larger fonts and as smaller value will
give you smaller fonts.  The default is "96".  This setting is stored in
the Display Manager  configuration file.  On <antiX this is /etc/slim.conf.


Miscellaneous Options
---------------------

    md5|checkmd5

Check the md5sum of the three primary files needed to boot a live
system: "linuxfs", "vmlinuz", and "initrd.gz".  If this test passes then
your boot media should be good although this won't necessarily catch
intermittent problems.

    checkfs

Check the ext2/3/4 file systems that are invovled in the live boot
process.

    nocheckfs

The live-usb, like an installed system, will periodically check
its own file system based the time since the last check and/or the
number of mounts since the last check.  Use this option to turn this
feature off.

    toram

Copy the entire "linuxfs" file into RAM.  This takes up RAM.  The amount
of RAM used will be about the same as the size of the .iso file used to
create the LiveCD or live-usb.  It will also take some time when you
first boot to copy the file into RAM.  But after this, the system will
run very fast.  You can also eject the LiveCD (or remove the live-usb
while the system is running.

    norepo

Don't localize the Debian antiX/MX repositories based on timezone.

    norepo=aa,bb,cc

Don't localize the antiX/MX repositories to "aa", "bb", or 'cc".  Instead,
localize to the next closest repository.  Codes:

Disable Services
-----------------

    disable=*

For faster booting and to lower resources consumption you can disable
some system services and some Live features using the "disable=*" boot
option.  The default value for antiX is "disable=lx" which is explained
below.  Live features, whether enabled or not, do not carry over to
installed systems.  Likewise, services disabled with the "disable=*" are
not disabled automatically on installed systems.  Some of these can
replace a boot parameter (such as "l" for "lean")  In those cases the
boot parameter that is replaced is listed after the disable letter.

A list of actual services that have been disabled is available in the
file "/etc/live/config/disabled".  You can enable and disable services
after you boot with the "services" command.

    a                disable acpid service
    A                Enable acpid service
    B                Enable bootclean.sh service (disabled by default)
    c                disable connmand service
    d [nodbus]       disable dbus service
    F                Enable fbcondecor (console decoration)
    g                disable gpm service (mouse on virtual consoles)
    i                disable ifplugd service
    l [lean]         disable "lean" services (see below)
    L                Enabled syslogd service
    m [mean]         disable "mean" services (see below)
    n                disable nfs service
    N                Enable ntpd service (disbabled by default)
    P                Enable pamd service (disabled by default)
    r [norepo]       don't localize repos based on timezone
    s [nosavestate]  don't save state on live-usb systems
    S [savestate]    DO save state on live-usb systems
    v                disable VirtualBox services
    V                Don't blacklist fb modules, nvidiafb, etc.
      [vboxdecor]    Enable fbcondecor in Virtual Box
    x [Xtralean]     disable "Xtra-lean" services (see below)
    Y                Enable Plymouth (disabled by default)

Note 1: Virtual Box services are enabled automatically when run
on Virtual Box and disabled automatically when not.

Note 2: If a laptop is detected then acpid and wicd are excluded
from the list of lean services.  They can still be disabled on with "a"
and "w".

Lean Services (l):

    acpi-support   cpufrequtils   loadcpufreq    rsyslog
    acpid          cron           nfs-common     saned
    bluetooth      cups           rpcbind        smartmontools
    bootlogs       irqbalance     rsync          ssh

Xtralean Services (x):

    network-manager            smbd
    networking                 ufw
    nfs-common


Personalization
---------------

These options let you customize or personalize your system.  They will
all be carried over to the hard drive when you install.

    desktop=*

This option sets the default window manager and desktop icon manager (if
any).  For example: "desktop=rox-icewm" will set the window manager to
be IceWM and will use Rox to handle desktop icons.  The only other icon
manager available is SpaceFM.  So "desktop=space-fluxbox" will use
Fluxbox as the window manager and use SpaceFM to handle desktop icons.

    desktheme=[dark|light]

Use a [dark|light] theme for the wallpaper and window decorations.

    hostname=*

Set the hostname of the system.  The default hostname is "antiX1".

    hwclock=[utc|local|ask]

Assume the hardware clock is set to UTC, or localtime or have the system
help you guess what it is set to based on your timezone.  Normally
Windows machine have the hardware clock set to localtime while
Linux-only machines have it set to UTC.  The Live system will not change
your hardware clock but it will read it and use it to figure out what
time it is.

    lang=*

In antiX and MX this option sets more than just the language.  It also
sets the keyboard layout, the Debian mirror, the antiX/MX mirror and the
timezone.  If you set any of these others explicitly then that setting
will over-ride the value set via "lang".

    mirror=*

Set the country of the Debian mirror.  Also set the antiX/MX mirror to
the one closest to that country.  Usually this option is set to a
2-letter country code such as "mirror=gr".

    tz=*

Set the timezone.  Example: "tz=America/Denver".  Some languages, such
as en_US (United States English) cover more than one timezone so setting
the "lang" may not set the correct timezone.


Loading Modules
---------------

One of the primary tasks of the live-initrd is to mount the device that
holds the "linuxfs" file which contains the final file system.  Modules
(also called drivers) sometimes need to be loaded to allow the kernel to
talk to certain types of hardware.  Most of the time this is taken care
of automatically but if you have very old or unusual hardware, there
might be a glitch.

    load=*

Load one or more specific modules, separated by commas.  You need to
know the name of the module or modules you need for this to be useful.

    load=all

Load all modules in the initrd that are not hardware specific.  This is
a shotgun approach just in case there is a module that is available in
the initrd that needs to be manually loaded for your system to boot.

    noload

Don't automatically load the standard list of modules.

    blacklist=x,y,z

Don't load modules x or y or z.


Other Booting options
---------------------

These options affect the boot process but the don't fit into any of the
categories above.

    fromiso=*

Use this to boot from a iso file.  This feature is deprecated because it
defaults some of the more advanced features of the Live system but is
supported due to popular (or otherwise) demand.  This can be abbreviated
as "iso=*".

    try=*

The maximum number of seconds to try finding the boot directory.  The
default is 15 seconds.  This replaces "rootdelay" which is no longer
used.

=head2 Debugging

Sometimes booting problems can be tracked down to a missing driver or a
driver that is not getting loaded.  These two boot parameters can be
helpful in tracking down such problems.

    bp=*

Set one or more breakpoints in the live-init script separated by commas.
Use "bp=ask" to get a list of breakpoints to choose from.  The meanings
may change with different versions so use "bp=ask" to be sure.  The "b9"
breakpoint does the same thing as the "bash" breakpoint.

     1) before welcome
     2) before coldplug
     3) before looking for linuxfs file
     4) after mounting boot device
     5) after mounting persistence device
     6) after mounting aufs
     7) after prepare switch_root
     8) before running live init.d scripts
     9) right before starting init
     e) On possibly fatal error
    b8) Bash shell before running live init.d scripts
    b9) Bash shell before the system starts

    verb=*

Control how much gets printed out during the early boot process.  The
default level is "verb=5".  Lower numbers print less, higher numbers
print more.  Usually "6" or "7" will show you more info without being
too obnoxious.  The full output is available in the file
/var/log/live/initrd.log.  A partial version of the log file is
available at /init.log from within most breakpoints.


Live-usb Special Features
-------------------------

We provide many special features that only work on LiveUSBs or Frugal
installs because these features take advantage of the ability to write
to a usb drive or an internal hard drive or solid state drive.

NOTE: A live-usb that was created with the "dd" command has a read-only
file system so it is treated just like a Live-cd.  So the term live-usb
below applies only to live systems that were built on a read-write file
system, be it a usb stick, an external drive, or an internal drive.  We
highly recommend you use the live-usb-maker(-gui) tool to create antiX
and MX live-usbs.

Persistence
^^^^^^^^^^^

These options enable and control Live persistence which allows you to make
changes that will persist across reboots.  These options are normally used on
LiveUSBs but if you specify a persistence device (or use the default LiveCD
persistence device) then you can make use persistence on a LiveCD.  In this
case, the changes will have to be saved on some other device that allows for
read-write access.

If you enable persistence on a LiveCD and and device with the label
antiX-Persist is not found then we will give you a list of partitions to
choose from and offer to give that device the label "antiX-Persist".  If a
form of persistence is "required" but the persistence file is not found then
we will offer to create it for you.  We do not offer to create a persistence
file if it is merely "requested" with one exception.  If root persistence is
required and home persistence is requested and neither "rootfs" nor "homefs"
persistence files exist then we will offer to create both a "rootfs" file and
a "homefs" file.

=head3 Convenience Persistence/Frugal Options

The following cheat codes are available in the "F5 Persist" menu in the
legacy bootloader.  They are provided so you don't have to understand
the more flexible "persist=*" and "frugal=*" parameters.  This first
group enable persistence but not frugal:

  persist_all       persist=root!,home!        required root and home persistence
  persist_root      pesist=root!               required root persistence
  persist_static    persist=root!,home!,static required home and static root persistence
  persist_home      persist=home!              required home persistence
  p_static_root     persist=root!,static       required static root persistence

This second group enable frugal and persistence:

  frugal_persist    frugal=root!,home!         required root nad home persistence
  frugal_root       frugal=root!               required root persistence
  frugal_static     frugal=root!,home!,static  required home and static root persistence
  frugal_home       frugal=home!               required home persistence
  f_static_root     persist=root!,static       required static root persistence
  frugal_only       frugal                     no persistence


The main persistence Option
---------------------------

    persist=*

This is the main option for enabling persistence.  It provides more
flexibility than the convenience parameters listed above.  The
"frugal=*" option works exactly the same way so once you understand
"persist=*" you also understand "frugal=*".

    auto,a

Automatically create "rootfs" and/or "homefs" files if they don't already
exist and they are required.  Normally, we will prompt the user for size and
file system type.

    hd

Only look on internal hard drives for the persistence device.  This is
analogous to "from=hd" for finding the boot device.

    home!|h!

Enable and require home persistence.  The exclamation point means this form of
persistence is required.  A non-fatal error will be thrown if it cannot be
enabled.

    home|h

Request home persistence but don't require it.  We will try to enable home
persistence but if we can't then this fact is briefly noted and the boot
continues normally.

    root!|r!

Enable and require root persistence.  The exclamation point means this form of
persistence is required.  A non-fatal error will be thrown if it cannot be
enabled.

    root|r

Request root persistence but don't require it.  We will try to enable root
persistence but if we can't then this fact is briefly noted and the boot
continues normally.

    static|s

If root persistence is enabled then use the static version of root persistence.
Normally, dynamic root persistence is used.

    usb

Only look on usb partitions for the persistence device.  This is analogous to
"from=usb" for finding the boot device.


The Persistence Device
----------------------

Just like the boot device can be specified generally with the "from=*" option
and more specifically with options like "bdev=*", the same choices are
available for specifying the persistence device.

On a live-usb or a frugal install, the default persistence device is the boot
device which is what you would expect.  Normally the persistence files will sit
alongside the "linuxfs" file that we are booting from.

On a LiveCD the default persistence device is whatever device has the disk
label "antiX-Persist".  If you specify a persistence device with one of the
three options below then the defaults are ignored.


    pdev=*

The name of the persistence device.  For example "pdev=sdb2".

    plab=*

The partition label of the persistence device.

    puuid=*

The UUID of the persistence device.  Like with "buuid=*" this parameter
accepts wildcards like "*" so you don't have to type in the entire UUID.


Other Persistence Options
-------------------------

These options don't fit into any of the previous categories.

    ptry=*

How many seconds to wait for the persistence device to appear.  This is only
relevant if the peristence device is different from the boot device.  The
default is 10 seconds.


Remastering (live-usb Only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These two options affect remastering.  Normally, remastering is done
automatically whenever there is a "linuxfs.new" file in the same directory as
the "linuxfs" file.

    noremaster

Disable remastering even when a "linuxfs.new" file is found.

    rollback

Roll back to the previous version of "linuxfs".   If you remaster and
for some reason things go horribly wrong, then use this feature to get
back to the state right before you did the remaster.


Frugal Install
--------------

Automatically do a frugal install from a LiveCD or live-usb to a hard
drive or a usb drive.  Persistence files can also be created
automatically so you can literally create and boot into an installed
system in just a minute or two (depending on the speed of your
hardware).

There are two modes of operation that are triggered by the same "frugal"
boot parameter: install mode and boot mode.  Normally the frugal device
is a partition  with the label "antiX-Frugal".  If such a device is not
found then you will be given a list of partitions to choose from.  Once
you have selected a device, you will be given an option to have it give
the "antiX-Frugal" label.  If an antiX frugal install has not already
been done on the device you selected then an frugal install will be
performed.

The next time you boot with the frugal option, we will automatically
boot from the "antiX-Frugal" device into the frugal system that was
installed. Again, if a frugal install is not found on that device, we
will automatically create one.

If persistence is requested and the persistence files are not found then
we will offer to create them after we do the install.  If you want to
force a persistence file to be created in a later boot then "require"
that form of persistence with an exclaimation point.

    frugal=root     (requested)
    frugal=root!    (required)
    frugal

Enable frugal mode.  Either boot into the existing frugal system or
create a new one if it does not already exist.

    frugal=*

A contraction of "frugal persist=*".   It is common to add persist
options when enabling frugal mode so you can add the persist options
directly to the frugal boot parameter. Example: "frugal=root,home".


The Frugal Device
-----------------
Just like you can select the boot device and the persistence device with
device name, label, or uuid, you can do the same with the frugal device.
If you specify the frugal device this way and it is not found then we
will give you a list of devices to choose from, just like with the
"frugal" parameter, but we will "not" offer to label the device you have
selected.

    fdev=*

The name of the frugal device.

    flab=*

The partition label of the frugal device.

    fuuid=*

The UUID of the frugal partition.

Miscellaneous live-usb Options
------------------------------
Most of these options take advantage of the read-write file system on a
live-usb and save extra information directly to the live-usb file
system.  Most of them also work on a frugal install.

    checkfs

Perform file system check on the "live-usb".  This won't check the file system
of a LiveCD.  Will also check the file system of the persistence device (if
different from the boot device) and the file systems on the persistence files
"rootfs" and "homefs" if they exist and are enabled.  It will only check the
following types of file systems: ext2, ext3, and ext4.

    gfxsave
    gfxsave=*

Set the bootloader current bootloader settings as the defaults.  Valid
values: "custom", "menus", "both", and "reset".  Plain "gfxsave" means
"gfxsave=both".

    dostore

Enable the live-usb-Storage feature which creates a "live-usb-Storage/"
directory in the user's home directory that gives direct access to any
extra storage space on the live-usb file system.  This option is enabled
by default and it is sticky.  Once it is enabled it will stay enabled
until you disable it with the "nostore" option.

    nostore

Disable the live-usb-Storage feature.  This is also sticky.  Once you
turn the storage feature off it will stay off until you turn it back on
again with "dostore".

    savestate

Enable saving "state" files across reboots.  This is enabled by default
and sticky.

During the first live boot the directory "/antiX/state" is created and
populated with two files: "general-state-files" and
"machine-state-files".  These files contain lists of files to be saved
directly on the live-usb across reboots.  This provides some persistence
even if no form of persistence is enabled.  For example, if you use
"wicd" to connect to a wireless network then this feature will remember
your wireless passwords across reboots.

General State Files are shared between machines but Machine State Files
are only restored to the machine they were saved on.  This allows you to
use the same live-usb on different computers even if some of those
computers require hardware specific settings.

    nosavestate

Disable the save state feature.  This is also sticky so once you disable
saving state it will stay disabled until you enable it again with
"savestate".
