README: Template/Arch/
======================

This directory mirrors the role of `Template/` but for Arch-based builds.

- `COMMON/`: lists and overlay content shared by all Arch flavours.
- `<flavour>/`: per-flavour package lists and overlays (examples: `arch64/`, `mx64/`).

List files follow the same rules as the Debian templates:
- `*.list` contains one item per line, `#` starts a comment.
- The builder combines `COMMON/` + `<respin>-AND-*` + `<flavour>/` and dedupes.
